# MAGNUS Development Journal

This document chronologically tracks key development decisions, challenges, and milestones.

## April 19, 2025 - Accumulator Implementations

### Completed Components
- **Dense Accumulator**: Implemented based on Algorithm 1 in the MAGNUS paper
- **Sort-based Accumulator**: Implemented based on Algorithm 2 in the MAGNUS paper
- **Accumulator Trait**: Created a polymorphic interface for different accumulator types
- **Factory Function**: Implemented selection logic between dense and sort-based accumulators
- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Comprehensive testing for both accumulator types

### Key Decisions
- **Trait-based Design**: Created the `Accumulator` trait for polymorphic behavior
- **Parameterized Selection**: Used a threshold-based approach to select the appropriate accumulator
- **Testing Strategy**: Implemented direct comparisons between different accumulators
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive doc comments and rustdoc building

### Challenges Overcome
- Resolved floating-point ambiguity in tests by using explicit type annotations
- Fixed trait object extraction issues with improved test design
- Handled GitHub Actions configuration for documentation deployment

### Next Steps
- Implement reordering strategies (fine-level and coarse-level)
- Integrate accumulators with the main SpGEMM function
- Add parallel execution support

## April 18, 2025 - Project Initialization

### Project Structure Established
- Created project roadmap with phased implementation approach
- Prioritized working prototype over performance optimizations
- Established realistic timeline (30-40 weeks part-time)
- Set up documentation structure with master document
- Set up Rust project with cargo and implemented basic matrix formats
- Created CSR and CSC matrix implementations with format conversions
- Implemented row categorization based on Section 3.1 of MAGNUS paper
- Created a reference SpGEMM implementation for testing

### Key Decisions
- **Implementation Approach**: Focus on test-driven development and correctness first
- **Timeline Adjustment**: Extended timeline to account for learning Rust while implementing
- **Documentation Strategy**: Created master document and development journal
- **Technology Selection**: Confirmed Rust as implementation language with possible GPU acceleration
- **Matrix Formats**: Chose to implement both CSR and CSC formats for flexibility
- **Testing Strategy**: Created a reference implementation to validate results
