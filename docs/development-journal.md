# MAGNUS Development Journal

This document chronologically tracks key development decisions, challenges, and milestones.

## April 18, 2025 - Project Initialization

### Project Structure Established
- Created project roadmap with phased implementation approach
- Prioritized working prototype over performance optimizations
- Established realistic timeline (30-40 weeks part-time)
- Set up documentation structure with master document

### Key Decisions
- **Implementation Approach**: Focus on test-driven development and correctness first
- **Timeline Adjustment**: Extended timeline to account for learning Rust while implementing
- **Documentation Strategy**: Created master document and development journal
- **Technology Selection**: Confirmed Rust as implementation language with possible GPU acceleration

### Next Steps
- Set up Rust project with cargo
- Identify and list initial dependencies
- Create testing framework
- Begin implementing basic matrix formats
