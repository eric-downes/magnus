# MAGNUS Project Master Document

*Last updated: January 16, 2025*

## Project Overview

MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multicore Systems) is an algorithm
for multiplying large sparse matrices, as described in [this
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07056). This project implements
MAGNUS in Rust with a focus on correctness, performance, and
cross-platform support.

## Current Status

**Current Phase**: Performance Optimization (Phase 3)

### ‚úÖ Completed Components
- **Core Algorithm**: Full MAGNUS implementation with all four row categorization strategies
- **Matrix Formats**: CSR/CSC with bidirectional conversion utilities
- **Accumulator Methods**: Dense and sort-based with pluggable interface
- **Reordering Algorithms**: Fine-level and coarse-level locality generation
- **Parallel Execution**: Row-level and chunk-level parallelism via Rayon
- **Hardware Optimizations**: ARM NEON, Apple Accelerate, Metal GPU support
- **Prefetch System**: Smart prefetching for cache optimization
- **Test Suite**: 65+ unit tests, 20+ integration tests, 11 benchmarks

### üöß Active Development
- Performance benchmarking and parameter tuning
- Cross-platform optimization validation
- SuiteSparse matrix integration for real-world testing

### ‚è≥ Upcoming Work
- Intel AVX-512 optimizations
- Modified compare-exchange accumulator implementation
- Comprehensive performance documentation
- Production API stabilization

### Documentation Guidelines

1. **Update Frequency**: 
   - This master document will be reviewed at the start of each development session
   - This master document will be updated at the end of each development session.
     - and at the start if discrepancies arise upon review.
   - Development journal entries will be added after significant progress or decisions

2. **Document Structure**:
   - Keep documents focused and specific
   - Use markdown headers and lists for easy navigation
   - Link between documents where appropriate
   - Include dates with all entries

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Current phase and status will be maintained in this document
   - Development journal will record detailed progress
   - Each document will include a "Last updated" date
